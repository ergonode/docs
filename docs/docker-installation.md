# Ergonode development docker

This is only a development solution! Do not use it on production environments!

## the docker uses the following services

 - PostgreSQL 10
 - PHP 7.4
 - NGINX 1.17
 - Docsify 4
 - Nodejs 12.6 
 - RabbitMQ 3.8
 
## How the hell should I install it all ?!

At first you must install Docker and Docker Compose (https://docs.docker.com/compose).

Next, you must clone frontend and backend and docs repositories to ergonode directory:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ergonode/docker.git ergonode
cd ergonode
git clone git@github.com:ergonode/frontend.git
git clone git@github.com:ergonode/backend.git
git clone git@github.com:ergonode/docs.git
```


If you want to test ergonode in multiple directories you need to create the  `.env` file and set
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME env var to some unique value

If you want't change any environment variable you can optionally  change this in the `.env` file. 
And all environment variables used by our docker you can find in the `docker-compose.yml` files.

Now you can start start docker by simple command

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Now you can fill  app database with basic data by using command
```
docker-compose exec php bin/phing database:fixture
```

Or fill database with development data with command
```
docker-compose exec php bin/phing database:fixture:dev
```

Enjoy :)
