### [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/)

A **progressive framework** for building user interfaces. <br>
Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. <br>The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. <br>On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications <br>when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.


### [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/)

A **higher-level framework** that builds on top of Vue. It simplifies the development of universal or single page Vue apps.<br>
Nuxt.js abstracts away the details of server and client code distribution so you can focus on application development. <br>The goal with Nuxt is for it to be flexible enough for you to use as a main project base. <br>Because most of what Nuxt does happens during the development phase, you get a lot of features with only a few extra kilobytes added to your JavaScript files.

### [VueMS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ergonode/vuems)

A simple **mechanism to transform** a monolithic Vue application into an application based on Micro Services architecture.


### [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/)

A **state management pattern** + library for Vue.js applications. <br>It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion. <br>It also integrates with Vue's official devtools extension to provide advanced features such as zero-config time-travel debugging and state snapshot export / import.



### [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/)

A **style sheet language**. It allows to use variables, nested rules, mixing, <br> inline imports and more with a fully CSS-compatible syntax.

### Coding standards

#### [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started)

A **tool for identifying and reporting on patterns** found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, <br>with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs. <br>In many ways, it is similar to JSLint and JSHint. <br>

#### [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/)

A mighty, modern **linter** that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions in your styles.


### Tests

#### [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started)
A **comprehensive JavaScript testing solution**. Works out of the box for most JavaScript projects.<br>
Fast, interactive watch mode only runs test files related to changed files.

#### [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress.html#In-a-nutshell)

An open source **tool to automate e2e tests**. <br>
It is based on the Node.js platform, which means that the code for our tests is written in JavaScript.<br>
Cypress offers a wide range of possibilities to create automatic tests. <br>
By using JS, we can write our tests in a simple, short and legible form.


## Documentation

### [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/?id=docsify)
docsify **generates your documentation** website on the fly. <br>Unlike GitBook, it does not generate static html files. <br>Instead, it smartly loads and parses your Markdown files and displays them as a website. <br>To start using it, all you need to do is create an index.html and deploy it on GitHub Pages.

### [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction)
A **tool for UI development**. It makes development faster and easier by isolating components. This allows you to work on one component at a time. You can develop entire UIs without needing to start up a complex dev stack, force certain data into your database, or navigate around your application.

### [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky)

Husky improves your commits.

### [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/)

EditorConfig helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs.

### [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/#about)

A tool for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages.
