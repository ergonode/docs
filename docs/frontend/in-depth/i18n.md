# i18n interface translations

The i18n mechanism is a library that allows you to add interface translations more easily.<br>
In our application we used a ready-made solution based on the [nuxt/i18n][i18n] library.<br>

### Introduction
---
The main configuration of the library is located in the file `nuxt.config.js`, <br>
there are the most important things needed to run the library on our system. <br>
The mechanism for changing the language is embedded in the user profile <br>
and the language is set when the user logs in. <br>

The [nuxt/i18n][i18n] library is compressed with [VueMS][vuems],
which helps to create target files with a translator.<br>

> There must always be a default language, here it is **English**. <br>
The translations must have these translations in order to be displayed correctly.<br>
If you set a language to which there is no translation, the default language will be inserted.

### Structure
---

Ergonode modular architecture allows you to add separate translations to each module.<br>
Then [VueMS][vuems] combines the translation file from all the modules <br>
and provides a complete translation file, which is used by the [nuxt/i18n][i18n] library.<br>
In the `nuxt.config.js`. file, [VueMS][vuems] has its own setting to determine whether <br>
the project uses the [nuxt/i18n][i18n] library and which languages are supported.

```javascript
    vuems: {
        i18n: true,
        i18nLocales: [
            'en_GB',
            'pl_PL',
        ],
        ...
    },
```

Translation files are loaded as needed, and the entire supervision mechanism is placed in **Core** module on `i18n.js ` plugin.

The global `this.$setInterfaceLanguage()` method is responsible for language setting.<br>
The global method `$t()` is responsible for substituting translations.


> Translations with the same keys will be overwritten (depending on the order of loading the modules).

### Add translations
---
For translations in the module corresponds to the directory `locales` and JSON files with translations.<br>
The name of the translation file must be the same as the language code in which we translate (e.g. `en_GB.json`).<br>

Translations in object-oriented format:

```json
    {
        "attribute": {
            "page": {
                "title": "Attributes",
            }
        }
    }
```
which is then used in the application code.

```html
    <TitleBar :title="$t('attribute.page.title')">
        ...
    <TitleBar>
```

<div class="Alert Alert--warning">

It is important to start the structure of the translation object with the **name of the module** in which the translation is located.

</div>

Adding a new translator language involves adding a new translator file.

**`en_GB.json`:**
```json
    {
        "attribute": {
            "page": {
                "title": "Attributes",
            }
        }
    }
```
**`pl_PL.json`:**
```json
    {
        "attribute": {
            "page": {
                "title": "Atrybuty",
            }
        }
    }
```
