# Installation

**Ergonode** is an extensive application with several repositories. <br>
The system itself is divided into 2 parts - [**frontend**][front] and [**backend**][back], which work independently of each other. <br>
This may complicate the installation process, but we have created a precise installation guide every time our application is used.<br>


1. If you are a developer who is interested in **open-source** projects, you're in the right place because **Ergonode** is such a project.<br>
You will be very interested in installing the application this way:<br>
 - [Frontend contribution installation][cf]
 - [Backend contribution installation][cb]

2. You are our implementation partner and you are looking for instances of how to quickly build an application skeleton for your client.<br>
You will be very interested in installing the application in such a way:
 - [Frontend partner installation][pf]
 - [Backend partner installation][pb]

3. We also have for you a docker repository with our project, which will certainly make the work easier for many people:
  - [Docker installation][docker]
